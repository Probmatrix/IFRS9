Extended Contractual Period for Revolving Finance in IFRS 9

What is Contractual Period?
The contractual period typically refers to the short, predefined time (e.g., 30-60 days) during which a lender can revoke or modify the credit facility. Revolving credit products like credit cards, overdrafts, and running finance offer flexibility to borrowers, but they come with unique challenges in assessing credit risk. 

Why go beyond the contractual period?
Real-world usage shows that borrowers often continue to draw down credit, make minimum payments, or delay repayments, resulting in extended credit exposure. IFRS 9 mandates that financial institutions account for these behavioral patterns and adjust their models to estimate ECL over a longer period, capturing the realistic risk horizon.

We have pasted the link to download an easy-to-use Excel calculator to help you estimate the extended contractual period for any revolving credit products. As an example, the tool includes dummy data for credit cards to demonstrate data inputs and results. However, the calculator does not account for the behavioral patterns and macroeconomic adjustments. 

For a more comprehensive approach, Probmatrix offers a powerful and intuitive tool designed to calculate the dynamic expected life of revolving products in alignment with IFRS 9 requirements. This advanced tool accounts for critical factors such as borrower behavioral patterns, macroeconomic scenarios, Probability of Default (PD), and borrower ratings or buckets. Additionally, the tool is accompanied by detailed documentation to ensure ease of use and understanding.
